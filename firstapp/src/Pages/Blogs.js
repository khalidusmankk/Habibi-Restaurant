        <h3> How to reach Kumrat?</h3>
         <h4>Simple: </h4>
         <p> Kumrat was discovered and disclosed by Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan. After visit of Imran Khan in 2016, the Kumrat was famous and people turned towards an enormous but intense valley.</p>
         <p>Most people come up to Kotgal. Some come up to Kashin Ghera Aus (Kala Paani) and some reaches to Do Jangah, further people go ahead. There is no road ahead of Do Jangah, hence the area is anonymous, Shazur and Kashkin Goreshai are also among those unusual areas but really very beautiful.</p>
         <p> To reach here, you must first come to the last village of Dir Kohistan’s known as Thal Kohistan. You must Come to Timergara, Dir Lower  then on dir road, rabat, Khal, Warhi Gandigar, to Baab e Kumrat and then to Sheringal, Patrak, to Thal. From Thal Village and upto Do Jangah you can reach by your Jeep or Car.</p>


         <h3> Detailed Iternary:</h3>
         <p> The village at the entrance to Kumrat Valley is named Thall. It’s a small village in Upper Dir district, with very basic amenities.

            When you arrive in Thall, it’s best to stay there for the day to organize onwards travel and supplies, though it’s possible to make it into Kumrat Valley on the same day.

            To get from Thall to Kumrat Valley, you need to hire a Jeep with driver. The road into the valley is poor, and can be washed out by rains. It will take an hour or two to drive through the narrow valley to the point where the mountains open wide again, and you’ll pass an army checkpoint along the way.</p>
         <p>There are plentiful tent camps in the valley during season, and generally offer similar facilities at similar rates.

            Basic food amenities are available at the tent camps, and there are small convenience stores every once in a while. Options are limited (and costly, of course), so bring your own food and snacks if you can.</p>
         <p>If you want to head out towards Dir—ideal if Chitral and the Kalash Valleys are next on your itinerary—shared taxis leave for Dir from the main Thall bazaar, close to where the turn for Kumrat is. The ride should take 6 to 8 hours depending on the driver.

            Bringing a guide can save you a lot of hassle, as English is hardly spoken in Thall or Kumrat Valley.</p>
